# Music Sheet Project
Design of an algorithm to manipulate musicXML and MIDI files. The application used to test and compare results is Musescore (https://musescore.org/en).
The program was written in python, aiming for an object-oriented approach. As for the paradigm used for musical notation, I considered the metrics composing each of the parts.
